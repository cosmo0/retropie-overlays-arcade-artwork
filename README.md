# Retropie artwork arcade overlays pack

Overlays (or bezels) are images added "above" the emulator, to mask the black borders around the image.

This pack adds simple artwork overlays for arcade games.

**Usage of the pack in a commercial product is strictly forbidden.**

## Credits

Please see [credits](CREDITS.md) to check out the awesome original packs I picked from.  
I did mostly nothing except move files around and mess with config files. If you think these overlays are good, please go thank the original authors.

If one of your file is here and you want me to remove it, or want to be credited, please [file an issue](https://github.com/cosmo0/retropie-arcade-overlays/issues).

## Artwork overlays (2982 games)

Compilation of "artwork" decorations overlays.

There is an artwork or fanart images around the game area, to maximize it, and just cover the black border around with an image. Sometimes it's inspired from the artwork on the real cabinet, sometimes it's completely custom-made.

## Installation

Use the [Retropie Arcade Manager](https://github.com/cosmo0/retropie-arcade-manager/) tool to install these overlays.

The compilation is "complete", and does not care whether the games works on your raspberry pi, needs special hardware (lightgun...), does not work in MAME2003, etc.

No shader is configured ; you can set a system-wide shader by editing the `retroarch.cfg` file at the root of your system config folder.
